It is a time limited position and may be extended up to a maximum of eight years total. This position may be converted to a permanent, career or career-conditional appointment without further competition as long as all requirements are met. This position MAY be made permanent without further competition contingent upon verification of the incumbent's non-competitive eligibility (must be a 30% veteran, reinstatement eligible, etc., under competitive service).This position may be filled as a Temporary Promotion or a Temporary Reassignment and may be extended for current Department of Army employees. At the end of this period, you will return to your permanent position of record, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay. This position is obligated. An obligated position is one to which an employee has statutory restoration rights based on active military service, compensable injury or disability when fully recovered, or return rights based on having served an overseas tour(s). Obligated positions may also cover employees who have been on extended leave without pay under certain circumstances. When a position is obligated to an employee it means that he/she has an entitlement to that position. During the obligation period, the position may be filled on a temporary or permanent basis. When an obligated position is filled, the selected employee is required to sign an agreement acknowledging that (s)he is aware of the obligation and accepts the fact that (s)he may be displaced under reduction in force procedures at a later time. This is a TERM position. Although term employees often are hired following the same competitive procedures that are used for hiring permanent employees, term employees do not have status in the competitive service. Consequently, unless they attained status through an earlier appointment, they cannot be selected from their term appointment for permanent career or career conditional appointments through internal merit promotion procedures. Such conversions cannot occur without special legal authority. The authority for personnel demonstration projects (Title 5, United States Code (USC), Part 4703) is the only provision that currently allows the possibility of term conversions.
