Internship Program\nPositions are open to current students pursuing a qualifying degree or certificate in an accredited high school, college (including 4-year colleges/universities, community colleges, and junior colleges); professional, technical, vocational, and trade school; advanced degree programs; or other qualifying educational institution on at least a half-time basis (as defined by the institution in which the student is enrolled). Short-term training programs (e.g., several two-week programs completed) are not considered an academic course of study. Internship for current students in good standing at an accredited education. For this internship, you must be able to work full time during summer months or when not attending classes and if possible part-time the rest of the year while attending school. This intern position is designed to prepare a student trainee for employment after graduation as a Natural Resource Specialist (RANGER). Interns will be assigned tasks designed to increase familiarity with the target occupation in a real world work environment. For this internship, you must be a current student majoring in biological sciences, agriculture, natural resource management, chemistry, or related disciplines appropriate to the position. This is a student internship opportunity. Your transcripts are a required part of your application. This opportunity follows a standard promotional path: Internship selection will be made at the GS-03, GS-04 or GS-05. These grade levels are what typical college students in their second or third year of college may qualify. Within 120 days after completion of Internship requirements, you may be eligible for conversion to the entry-level for the target occupation. Entry level for these positions are typically at the GS-07 level. The actual grade level at the time of conversion depends on academic achievement and other factors. The full performance level of this potential permanent position is GS-09. Progression from the entry-level to the full performance level for this occupation will depend on successful completion of all requirements for promotion. Promotions may be considered after a year at each grade level, but are not guaranteed to occur on a specific time schedule. See requirements for conversion to permanent or term position in the \"Additional Information\" section below. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-03, students must have completed one full academic year of post-high school study. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-04, students must have completed two full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate's degree. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-05, students must have completed 4 academic years of post-high school leading to a bachelor's degree or equivalent degree. NOTE: Students that are graduating and are not subsequently enrolled in another program might not meet the work-hour requirements prior to graduation and will be at risk for not being able to convert to a career or career-conditional appointment! For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended. When academic credit is expressed in contract months, units, or other terms that differ from conventional semester or quarter hours, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an interpretation of such credits from the appropriate institution in order to equate them to the semester or quarter hours specified in the standard. NOTE: If your college, vocational, trade, technical or high schools' definition of \"academic year\" differs from above, you must submit proof of this difference (e.g., copy of course catalog that defines an academic year).

The curriculum for a degree in either architecture or architectural engineering covers function, esthetics, site, structure, economics, mechanical-electrical, and other engineering problems related to the design and construction of buildings primarily (but not exclusively) intended to house human activities. The courses required for a degree in architecture generally place emphasis upon planning, esthetics, and materials and methods of construction, while the courses for an architectural engineering degree place equal or greater weight on the technical engineering aspects such as structural systems, mechanical systems, and the properties of materials. Because of this difference in emphasis, persons with degrees in architecture may have a preference for work assignments that offer greater opportunities for them to express their artistic and creative abilities.
