These allowances are computed based on Department of State guidelines and are subject to change. Post Differential is currently 25% of basic pay up to 80 hours per pay period.

A Sunday premium of 25% of the hourly rate is authorized (NTE 16 hours per pay period). Separate Maintenance Allowance (SMA) is authorized for employees who maintain a separate household for their dependent family in the U.S. SMA is paid based on the number of dependents.

MAIL SERVICES: You are provided a mailing address similar to a U.S. post office box number.

Further, for items not available for purchase within Saudi Arabia (e.g. brand preference and/or clothing), you may order items from retail stores in the U.S. and have the items shipped to you. However, any items shipped must comply with Saudi Arabian customs requirements (i.e., items considered illegal in Saudi will be confiscated in customs (e.g., alcohol and pork, or products containing alcohol and pork, are forbidden in Saudi Arabia and cannot be shipped into the country).
