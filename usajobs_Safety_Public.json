Combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying professional engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:\n1. Professional registration -- Current registration as a professional engineer by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.\n2. Written Test-- Evidence of having successfully passed the Engineer-in-Training (EIT) examination, or the written test required for professional registration, which is administered by the Boards of Engineering Examiners in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\nApplicants who have passed the EIT examination and have completed all the requirements for either (a) a bachelor's degree in engineering technology (BET) from an accredited college of university that included 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences, or (b) a BET from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) may be rated eligible for certain engineering positions at GS-5. Eligibility is limited to positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of the engineering technology program. Applicants for positions that involve highly technical research, development, or similar functions requiring an advanced level of competence in basic science must meet the basic requirements in paragraph A.\nBecause of the diversity in kind and quality of BET programs, graduates of other BET programs are required to complete at least 1 year of additional education or highly technical work experience of such nature as to provide reasonable assurance of the possession of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for professional engineering competence. The adequacy of this background must be demonstrated by passing the EIT examination.\n3. Specified academic courses -- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and in engineering that included the courses specified in the basic requirements. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of a professional engineering curriculum as described in paragraph A.\n4. Related curriculum -- Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in engineering technology or in an appropriate professional field, e.g., physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. (The above examples of related curricula are not all-inclusive. Only degrees from an accredited college or university recognized by the Department of Education are acceptable to meet positive education requirements or to substitute for experience. For additional information, please go to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and U.S. Department of Education websites at http://www.opm.gov/qualifications and http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.html In addition to meeting the education requirements above, you must also meet the specialized experience.

Please read the following carefully.\nKey West is a truly unique tourist destination that many refer to as \"The American Caribbean\". The town lies at the end of a 130-mile-long island chain extending southwest of mainland Florida.\nThe Florida Keys are a string of barrier islands which are linked by \"The Overseas Highway\" (US 1) and naturally offer water-based recreational activities to those having an interest in such.\nKey West also offers a wide-variety of dining and entertainment options, influenced greatly by its rich history and diverse culture.\nAs is typical of any resort community, Key West has a high cost of living relative to the mainland, and a notable lack of affordable housing.\nFor example, a 1-bedroom, 1-bath rental unit averages from $1,500 to $2,000 depending on location and condition, and typically measures between 500 and 600 square feet.\nA 2-bedroom, 2-bath rental unit generally rents from $2,000 to $3,000, again depending on location and condition, and measures between 600 and 1,000 square feet.\nA single room in a house can rent anywhere from $1,000 to $1,200 a month.\nIn most cases, one is required to pay first and last months as well as a security deposit in one lump sum payment.\nThe cost to purchase a small house is, on average, $400,000 and up. A mobile home can be purchased for somewhere in the vicinity of $150,000.\nAlso to be considered: the Florida Keys are, geographically speaking, rather small and unidirectional, so the notion of moving \"further out\" to take advantage of lower housing costs is not realistic.\nIndicative monthly costs for basic utilities:\n- Electric - $150+\n- Water - $40+\n- Sewer - $35+\n- Garbage - $25+ NAS Key West does provide a limited number of government quarters to DoD civilian employees at fairly reasonable rental rates ranging from $1,500 to $2,500 per month depending on size of unit, number of bedrooms, and grade of employee. A security deposit equal to one month's rent is required.\nBasic utilities are included in the rental costs; however, cable, internet, and telephone are not. For additional information, you may contact the NAS Key West Housing Office at (305) 293-4422/4466. The current wait list for housing averages 3 to 6 months once an application is accepted.\nIt is highly recommended that interested parties take the time to visit the websites listed below for further information regarding costs of residential property and rental fees; and otherwise, in general, living in Key West:\n- http://www.keywestcitizen.com\n- http://www.fla-keys.com/keywest\n- http://keywestmls.rapmls.com/\n- http://www.keywestchamber.org/\n- http://www.keywestcity.com/","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"42895.0","MaximumRange":"61962.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.0000","PositionEndDate":"2022-02-14T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.0000","ApplicationCloseDate":"2022-02-14T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"You will serve as a FIREFIGHTER (BLS/HAZMAT TECHNICIAN) in the Fire and Emergency Services Department of NAS KEY WEST.
