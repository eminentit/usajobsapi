For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test - Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination, or any other written test required for professional registration, by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. 3.

If you are a current or former Federal Civilian employee and applying for a higher grade than the grade that you currently or formerly held within the last 52 weeks, it is recommended you provide SF-50(s) that show you have held the next lower grade for at least one year. Some SF-50s effective within the last 52 weeks will not demonstrate you have held the next lower grade for at least one year (e.g. General Adjustment SF-50 from this year). In many cases, you are required to provide two (2) SF-50s to determine you meet the one-year time-in-grade requirement and eligibility for promotion.

We will confirm time in grade at the job offer stage if needed. At a minimum, you are still required to provide an SF-50 at the lower grade level for promotion eligibility consideration when applying for a promotion for GS-positions. It is still recommended you provide a Within-Grade Increase (WGI) SF-50 or multiple SF-50's at least one year apart at the lower grade level for time in grade confirmation with your application. 2.
