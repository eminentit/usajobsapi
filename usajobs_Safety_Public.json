Coverage under Special Retirement Coverage is NOT automatic. However, an employee may bring their existing special retirement coverage with them if they meet the transfer requirements below. CSRS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46A, Section 46A3.2-1C - The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and if applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days.

You will be rated based on the information provided in your resume and responses to the questionnaire, along with your supporting documentation to determine your level of knowledge, skill, and ability related to the job requirements. Generally, only best qualified candidates will be referred to the hiring manager. Sometimes well qualified and minimally qualified candidates are referred. Occasionally, candidates eligible for priority consideration are referred, and no other candidates are referred. The hiring manager may choose to conduct interviews. You will be notified of our rating and referral decision. If you are referred, you will be notified when a hiring decision is made. NOTE: Due to COVID19, if you have any questions or need assistance, please email the DON Employment Information Center at DONEIC@us.navy.mil","RequiredDocuments":"You are required to provide documentation that supports the eligibility and qualification claims made in your resume and assessment questionnaire.
