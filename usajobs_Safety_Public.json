However, an employee may bring their existing special retirement coverage with them if they meet the transfer requirements below. CSRS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46A, Section 46A3.2-1C - The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and if applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days.\nFERS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46B, Section 463.2-1C 1.

Service as a temporary or intermittent employee may be counted toward the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying. (While under an intermittent tour of duty, only actual days worked are counted.) For purposes of applying the 3-year requirement, it does not matter whether the service is actually made creditable by payment of a deposit or whether the service cannot be made creditable. Thus, even post-1998 non-deduction service (which can never be creditable under FERS for the purpose of qualifying for or computing a benefit can be used to meet the 3-year requirement. Also, Federal service under another retirement system for Government employees may be used to meet the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying.\n2.
