A BQ military spouse possesses knowledge, skills, abilities, and competencies comparable to others who meet the competitive referral criteria for the specific position. Eligible DoD career or career conditional employees shall be granted statutory return rights to their former position for a period of 5 years if continuously employed in a foreign or non-foreign area provided by Executive Order 10895 and DoDI 1400.25, v 1230. Employees that do not exercise their return rights within five years are no longer eligible for return rights and will be treated as a local hire. This position is eligible for part time, full time or ad-hoc telework at the discretion of management. The DODI 1400.25 V1230 requires that we grant return rights to career and career-conditional DOD employees in the competitive service who are employed in the United States or in a non-foreign area (i.e., Hawaii and Alaska), who accept an assignment in a foreign area or in a non-foreign area different from the one in which they are currently employed. E.O. 10895 (1960s) designates AK and HI as outside the U.S. for purposes of applying 10 USC 1586 which is the law that provides statutory return rights. Tour extensions and things like dwell periods and physical presence after overseas tours do not apply. In summary, we should ensure that we afford return rights to eligible employees accepting positions in Hawaii and we coordinate with the losing/gaining activities. COLA: A Cost-of-Living-Allowance (COLA) of xx.xx% will be added to the stated salary. COLA is subject to change at any time.","KeyRequirements":[],"WithinArea":"False","CommuteDistance":"0","ServiceType":"01","AnnouncementClosingType":"01","AgencyContactEmail":"DONEIC@navy.mil","SecurityClearance":"Secret","DrugTestRequired":"False","AdjudicationType":[],"TeleworkEligible":true},"IsRadialSearch":false}},"RelevanceRank":0},{"MatchedObjectId":"624702500","MatchedObjectDescriptor":{"PositionID":"NH-11311611-AF-21-104","PositionTitle":"FIREFIGHTER","PositionURI":"https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/624702500","ApplyURI":["https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/624702500?PostingChannelID="],"PositionLocationDisplay":"Pease AFB, New Hampshire","PositionLocation":[{"LocationName":"Pease AFB, New Hampshire","CountryCode":"United States","CountrySubDivisionCode":"New Hampshire","CityName":"Pease AFB, New Hampshire","Longitude":-70.82492,"Latitude":43.08284}],"OrganizationName":"Air National Guard Units","DepartmentName":"Department of the Air Force","JobCategory":[{"Name":"Fire Protection and Prevention","Code":"0081"}],"JobGrade":[{"Code":"GS"}],"PositionSchedule":[{"Name":"Full-time","Code":"1"}],"PositionOfferingType":[{"Name":"Permanent","Code":"15317"}],"QualificationSummary":"As required by Executive Order 14043, Federal employees are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 regardless of the employee's duty location or work arrangement (e.g., telework, remote work, etc.), subject to such exceptions as required by law.
