This position has been identified by Department of Army and approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness as a secondary position for special retirement coverage as identified in 5 CFR 831 Subpart I for CSRS Retirement coverage and 5 CFR 842 Subpart H for FERS retirement coverage. Coverage under Special Retirement Coverage is NOT automatic. However, an employee may bring their existing special retirement coverage with them if they meet the transfer requirements below. CSRS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46A, Section 46A3.2-1C - The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and if applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. FERS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46B, Section 463.2-1C\n1. The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a rigorous position to a secondary position;\n2. The employee has completed 3 years of service in a rigorous position, including any such service during which no FERS deductions were withheld;\n3. If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. NOTES:\n1. Service as a temporary or intermittent employee may be counted toward the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying. (While under an intermittent tour of duty, only actual days worked are counted.) For purposes of applying the 3-year requirement, it does not matter whether the service is actually made creditable by payment of a deposit or whether the service cannot be made creditable. Thus, even post-1998 nondeduction service (which can never be creditable under FERS for the purpose of qualifying for or computing a benefit can be used to meet the 3-year requirement. Also, Federal service under another retirement system for Government employees may be used to meet the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying.\n2.
