Please read the following carefully: Key West is a truly unique tourist destination that many refer to as \"The American Caribbean\". The town lies at the end of a 130-mile-long island chain extending southwest of mainland Florida.\nThe Florida Keys are a string of barrier islands which are linked by \"The Overseas Highway\" (US 1) and naturally offer water-based recreational activities to those having an interest in such.\nKey West also offers a wide-variety of dining and entertainment options, influenced greatly by its rich history and diverse culture.\nAs is typical of any resort community, Key West has a high cost of living relative to the mainland, and a notable lack of affordable housing.\nFor example, a 1-bedroom, 1-bath rental unit averages from $2,000 to $2,500 depending on location and condition, and typically measures between 500 and 600 square feet.\nA 2-bedroom, 2-bath rental unit generally rents from $2,500 to $3,500, again depending on location and condition, and measures between 600 and 1,000 square feet.\nA single room in a house can rent anywhere from $1,500 to $1,700 a month.\nIn most cases, one is required to pay first and last months as well as a security deposit in one lump sum payment.\nThe cost to purchase a small house is, on average, $600,000 and up. A mobile home can be purchased for somewhere in the vicinity of $300,000.\nAlso to be considered: the Florida Keys are, geographically speaking, rather small and unidirectional, so the notion of moving \"further out\" to take advantage of lower housing costs is not realistic.\nIndicative monthly costs for basic utilities:\n- Electric - $150+\n- Water - $40+\n- Sewer - $35+\n- Garbage - $25+ NAS Key West does provide a limited number of government quarters to DoD civilian employees at fairly reasonable rental rates ranging from $1,500 to $2,800 per month depending on size of unit, number of bedrooms, and grade of employee. A security deposit equal to one month's rent is required.\nBasic utilities are included in the rental costs; however, cable, internet, and telephone are not. For additional information, you may contact the NAS Key West Housing Office at (305) 293-4422/4466.
