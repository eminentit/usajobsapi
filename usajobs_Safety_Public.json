Please read the following carefully.\nKey West is a truly unique tourist destination that many refer to as \"The American Caribbean\". The town lies at the end of a 130-mile-long island chain extending southwest of mainland Florida.\nThe Florida Keys are a string of barrier islands which are linked by \"The Overseas Highway\" (US 1) and naturally offer water-based recreational activities to those having an interest in such.\nKey West also offers a wide-variety of dining and entertainment options, influenced greatly by its rich history and diverse culture.\nAs is typical of any resort community, Key West has a high cost of living relative to the mainland, and a notable lack of affordable housing.\nFor example, a 1-bedroom, 1-bath rental unit averages from $1,500 to $2,000 depending on location and condition, and typically measures between 500 and 600 square feet.\nA 2-bedroom, 2-bath rental unit generally rents from $2,000 to $3,000, again depending on location and condition, and measures between 600 and 1,000 square feet.\nA single room in a house can rent anywhere from $1,000 to $1,200 a month.\nIn most cases, one is required to pay first and last months as well as a security deposit in one lump sum payment.\nThe cost to purchase a small house is, on average, $400,000 and up. A mobile home can be purchased for somewhere in the vicinity of $150,000.\nAlso to be considered: the Florida Keys are, geographically speaking, rather small and unidirectional, so the notion of moving \"further out\" to take advantage of lower housing costs is not realistic.\nIndicative monthly costs for basic utilities:\n- Electric - $150+\n- Water - $40+\n- Sewer - $35+\n- Garbage - $25+ NAS Key West does provide a limited number of government quarters to DoD civilian employees at fairly reasonable rental rates ranging from $1,500 to $2,500 per month depending on size of unit, number of bedrooms, and grade of employee. A security deposit equal to one month's rent is required.\nBasic utilities are included in the rental costs; however, cable, internet, and telephone are not. For additional information, you may contact the NAS Key West Housing Office at (305) 293-4422/4466. The current wait list for housing averages 3 to 6 months once an application is accepted.\nIt is highly recommended that interested parties take the time to visit the websites listed below for further information regarding costs of residential property and rental fees; and otherwise, in general, living in Key West:\n- http://www.keywestcitizen.com\n- http://www.fla-keys.com/keywest\n- http://keywestmls.rapmls.com/\n- http://www.keywestchamber.org/\n- http://www.keywestcity.com/","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"42895.0","MaximumRange":"61962.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.0000","PositionEndDate":"2022-02-14T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.0000","ApplicationCloseDate":"2022-02-14T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"You will serve as a FIREFIGHTER (BLS/HAZMAT TECHNICIAN) in the Fire and Emergency Services Department of NAS KEY WEST.

Are you applying for a promotion? If you are a current GS employee applying for a higher grade than the grade that you currently hold you must provide an SF-50 that shows that you have held the next lower grade for at least one year. Some SF-50s effective within the last 52 weeks will not demonstrate you have held the next lower grade for at least one year (e.g. General Adjustment SF-50 from this year).

If you have more than one DD-214 for multiple periods of active duty service, submit a copy for each period of service. If you were issued a DD-215 to amend aforementioned information on the DD-214 you must submit that too. If you are not sure of your preference eligibility, visit the Department of Labor's website: Veterans' Preference Advisor Are you a disabled veteran or claiming 10-point veterans' preference?\nIf you are eligible to claim 10 point veterans preference you must submit a DD-214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty as described above for 5-point preference.
