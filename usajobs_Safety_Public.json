However, an employee may bring their existing special retirement coverage with them if they meet the transfer requirements below. CSRS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46A, Section 46A3.2-1C - The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and if applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. FERS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46B, Section 463.2-1C\n1. The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a rigorous position to a secondary position;\n2. The employee has completed 3 years of service in a rigorous position, including any such service during which no FERS deductions were withheld; and\n3. If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. NOTES:\n1. Service as a temporary or intermittent employee may be counted toward the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying. (While under an intermittent tour of duty, only actual days worked are counted.) For purposes of applying the 3-year requirement, it does not matter whether the service is actually made creditable by payment of a deposit or whether the service cannot be made creditable. Thus, even post-1998 non-deduction service (which can never be creditable under FERS for the purpose of qualifying for or computing a benefit can be used to meet the 3-year requirement. Also, Federal service under another retirement system for Government employees may be used to meet the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying.\n2. A break in employment in secondary positions that begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause) within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(21)(A) is continuous for this purpose. In addition to providing the required eligibility documentation listed elsewhere in this job announcement, if you believe you are eligible for Special Retirement Coverage under a secondary position, you must provide sufficient documentation (SF-50s) as indicated above for verification. In order to qualify, you must meet the experience requirements described below. Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps, AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic; religious; spiritual; community; student; social). You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience. Your resume must clearly describe your relevant experience; if qualifying based on education, your transcripts will be required as part of your application. Additional information about transcripts is in this document. Specialized Experience: One year of specialized experience which includes: 1) Administer fire protection and prevention management programs such as, inspections, training, hazardous material handling, etc; 2) Develop and implement firefighting training activities such as, emergency medical response, hazardous material response, and fire suppression; 3) Administer and/or manage master operational roster and schedules of each shift to ensure adequate coverage, AND; 4) Oversee and direct firefighting and fire prevention activities of firefighting crews.

Coverage under Special Retirement Coverage is NOT automatic. However, an employee may bring their existing special retirement coverage with them if they meet the transfer requirements below.\nCSRS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46A, Section 46A3.2-1C - The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and if applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. FERS - Per CSRS and FERS Handbook, Subchapter 46B, Section 463.2-1C\n1. The employee, while covered under the special provision, moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a rigorous position to a secondary position;\n2. The employee has completed 3 years of service in a rigorous position, including any such service during which no FERS deductions were withheld; and\n3. If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. NOTES:\n1. Service as a temporary or intermittent employee may be counted toward the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying. (While under an intermittent tour of duty, only actual days worked are counted.) For purposes of applying the 3-year requirement, it does not matter whether the service is actually made creditable by payment of a deposit or whether the service cannot be made creditable. Thus, even post-1998 non-deduction service (which can never be creditable under FERS for the purpose of qualifying for or computing a benefit can be used to meet the 3-year requirement. Also, Federal service under another retirement system for Government employees may be used to meet the 3-year requirement if it is otherwise qualifying.\n2. A break in employment in secondary positions that begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause) within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(21)(A) is continuous for this purpose.\nIn addition to providing the required eligibility documentation listed elsewhere in this job announcement, if you believe you are eligible for Special Retirement Coverage under a secondary position, you must provide sufficient documentation (SF-50s) as indicated above for verification.
