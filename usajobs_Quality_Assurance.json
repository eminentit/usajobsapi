You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience. Physical Demands: Although approximately 40% of the work is performed in an office setting, extensive TDY trips are required resulting in continuous environmental changes. TDY trips are required for on-site inspections of contractor loading/discharging facilities (service/procurement) for Energy products, gas, oil, and Into-Plane contract locations. This requires considerable and strenuous physical exertion such as frequent climbing of tall ladders and crouching or crawling in restricted areas i.e., climbing up, onto, and into tanks in excess of 60 feet high and accessing petroleum marine vessel tankers via gangways/Jacobs Ladders. As well to stoop and bend while inspecting storage tanks and may take a couple of hours to complete. Some tanks may require cleaning and necessitating additional periods of standing and climbing. Operations involving support of U.S. military units engaged in combat support duties are also likely. Physical examination is required, both as a condition of employment as well as on a recurring annual basis. Work Environment: The nature of the work requires that the specialist, on a regular and recurring basis, be exposed to potentially dangerous situations. Work is outside, subject to inclement weather conditions, and occurs all hours of the day and night. In all cases, the incumbent is expected to enforce and observe all applicable safety precautions, including the use of personal protective equipment(e.g. toxic chemical protective clothing) and devices. The QAR works in the vicinity of explosive petroleum products, toxic laboratory chemicals, and toxic fuel additives. Incumbent is required to work extensive overtime periods in all types of environments. The QAR can also be voluntarily deployed in support of ongoing U.S. military operations on foreign soil. This is an Expeditionary Civilian (EC) position and the incumbent will be designated as (EE, NCE, etc.). In the event of a crisis situation, the incumbent may be required to deploy via temporary reassignment or be required to stay in place to support contingency operations. The incumbent may be required to take part in readiness exercises. This position cannot be vacated during a national emergency or mobilization without seriously impairing the capability of the organization to function effectively; therefore, the position requires the incumbent to be screened from military recall. Military Reservists selected for an EC position must arrange for a military deployment waiver from the Secretary Service level or transfer to the IRR Standby Reserve prior to appointment to an EC position. The waiver or transfer will remain in effect while assigned to the EC position. This requirement must be met prior to placement in an EC position. Positions identified as EE are subject to deployment to combat support situations. Deployment will be via Temporary Duty (TDY) orders. Deployment may entitle the employee to additional monetary compensation dependent upon the deployment location. Additional allocations are based on the Department of State's determination of a combat zone.","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"68299.0","MaximumRange":"88792.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2022-01-31T10:30:13.6200","PositionEndDate":"2022-02-11T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2022-01-31T10:30:13.6200","ApplicationCloseDate":"2022-02-11T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"See below for important information regarding this job.","WhoMayApply":{"Name":"","Code":""},"LowGrade":"12","HighGrade":"12","PromotionPotential":"None","OrganizationCodes":"DD/DD07","Relocation":"True","HiringPath":["fed-transition","overseas","disability","fed-internal-search","mspouse","vet"],"TotalOpenings":"3","AgencyMarketingStatement":"America's Combat Logistics Support Agency: The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) agency.
