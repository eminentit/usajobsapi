Physical Demands: Although approximately 40% of the work is performed in an office setting, extensive TDY trips are required resulting in continuous environmental changes. TDY trips are required for on-site inspections of contractor loading/discharging facilities (service/procurement) for Energy products, gas, oil, and Into-Plane contract locations.

Deployment may entitle the employee to additional monetary compensation dependent upon the deployment location.
