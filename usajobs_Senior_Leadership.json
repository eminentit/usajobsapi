Be sure to carefully read this announcement to see if additional information is required and how it should be submitted. QUALIFICATIONS REQUIREMENTS: Applicants will be assessed against qualifications which fall into two areas: Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) and Mandatory Technical Qualifications (MTQs). Failure to provide a separate narrative statement which describes fully and concisely how your experience meets the competencies described in the Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) and Mandatory Technical Qualifications (MTQs) will eliminate you from consideration. EXECUTIVE CORE QUALIFICATIONS: You will be assessed against the Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). They are designed to assess executive experience and potential - not technical expertise. They measure whether you have the broad executive skills needed in a variety of senior executive positions. Failure to meet a qualification requirement will disqualify an applicant. (Each must be addressed separately in your Supplemental Narrative Statement. The ECQs must not exceed 10 pages.) You are required to respond to all ECQs. If you fail to do so, you will be rated ineligible. When responding to the Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs), you must clearly show that you possess the experience, knowledge, skills and ability to perform the duties of this position by submitting narrative responses in which you detail your experience in each of the ECQs. Your examples should be clear and emphasize your level of responsibilities, scope and complexity of programs managed, program accomplishments with results of your actions, policy initiatives and level of contacts. You should limit your narrative to two pages per ECQ, and address each ECQ separately. More information on these core qualifications are available at: http://www.opm.gov/ses/recruitment/ecq.asp The ECQs describe the leadership skills needed to succeed as an SES: they also reinforce the concept of an \"SES corporate culture.\" Refer to the OPM Guide to SES Qualifications for specific information and guidance on the ECQ requirements, the Challenge-Context-Action-Result (C-C-A-R) model, and examples of good qualifications statements at the website: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/reference-materials/guidetosesquals_2012.pdf (Note: Current career Senior Executive Service (SES); former career Senior Executive Service (SES) who are reinstatement-eligible; and graduates of OPM-certified Candidate Development Programs are not required to address the ECQs, but must address the Mandatory Technical Qualifications.) ECQ 1 - Leading Change: This core qualification involves the ability to bring about strategic change, both within and outside the organization, to meet organizational goals. Inherent to this ECQ is the ability to establish an organizational vision and to implement it in a continuously changing environment. ECQ 2 - Leading People: This core qualification involves the ability to lead people toward meeting the organization's vision, mission, and goals. Inherent to this ECQ is the ability to provide an inclusive workplace that fosters the development of others, facilitates cooperation and teamwork, and supports constructive resolution of conflicts. ECQ 3 - Results Driven: This core qualification involves the ability to meet organizational goals and customer expectations. Inherent to this ECQ is the ability to make decisions that produce high-quality results by applying technical knowledge, analyzing problems, and calculating risks. ECQ 4 - Business Acumen: This core qualification involves the ability to manage human, financial, and information resources strategically. ECQ 5 - Building Coalitions: This core qualification involves the ability to build coalitions internally and with other Federal agencies, State and local governments, nonprofit and private sector organizations, foreign governments, or international organizations to achieve common goals. MANDATORY TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS: (Each must be addressed separately in your Supplemental Narrative Statement. You are required to respond to all of the technical qualifications. If you fail to do so you will be rated as ineligible. Each MTQ must not exceed 2 pages.) Proven ability to manage and lead a diverse professional, technical and administrative staff across multiple functional areas in a complex and dynamic environment involving multiple organizations with differing missions and often with differing views of issues. Includes the ability to bring together divergent views for common solutions to complicated problems. Demonstrated executive-level IT or healthcare IT experience and related experience as applied to successfully analyzing complex issues, working with external bodies and standards development organizations (SDOs) and translating organizational goals to executable programs of national significance and/or wide public interest to deliver cost-effective and business-focused solutions. Substantive knowledge of laws, policies, regulations, and guidelines governing Federal, Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Private Sector related to implementing national health data standards for interoperability. DoD Joint Enterprise-Wide Experience Statement: In addition, DoD requires an Enterprise Perspective. This individual must have the ability to apply a broad point of view and an awareness and understanding of individual or organizational responsibilities in relation to DoD or government-wide strategic priorities is required. Executives must demonstrate ability to work with internal and external partners to support national security objectives. This perspective is typically gained through a variety of diverse work experiences. A separate narrative statement is not required. This information should be embedded within the application package (Resume, Technical Qualifications and Executive Core Qualifications). Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g. professional, philanthropic, religious, spiritual, community, student, social). Volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and experience that translates directly to paid employment.","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"158541.0","MaximumRange":"199300.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00.0000","PositionEndDate":"2022-01-14T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00.0000","ApplicationCloseDate":"2022-01-14T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"About the Position: You will serve as the Director, Federal and Commercial Interoperability, located in the Defense Health Agency (DHA) with assignment to the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office.
