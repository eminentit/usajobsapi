The DoD Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The DoD OGC is the highest level legal organization in DoD. The DoD General Counsel is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and serves as the Chief Legal Officer of DoD, the legal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Defense Legal Services Agency (in which capacity he or she oversees the General Counsel Offices of over two dozen Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities). The Office is responsible for advising high-level policy makers in OSD. In addition, the DoD OGC works closely with senior attorneys and policy makers from the military departments, and with officials from the Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, and other Government agencies.","TravelCode":"0","MajorDuties":["The legal issues considered by DoD OGC are broad. While unique legal issues arise as a result of the national security and military missions of DoD, such as those involving international relations, military operations, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the DoD counternarcotics program, military education, industrial security, intelligence and counterintelligence policy, DoD OGC also advises in all of the practice areas common to the practice of law by Federal government attorneys in any Federal agency to include constitutional law issues, procurement and acquisition law, fiscal law, environmental law, property law, administrative law, employment and labor law, information disclosure (the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act), government ethics, legislation, litigation support, and the review of investigations. Perhaps surprising to those not familiar with DoD are the legal issues arising from practice areas that some may not immediately associate with DoD such as healthcare law (DoD runs its own hospital and health care system) and education law (DoD operates its own K-12 school system for military dependents, as well as undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate schools). Interns will be assigned to specific offices within DoD OGC or DLSA, such as the Offices of the Deputy General Counsels for Energy, Environment and Installations; Fiscal; International Affairs; Intelligence; Legal Counsel; or Personnel & Health Policy; the Standards of Conduct Office; and other DLSA offices such as the Offices of General Counsel for Washington Headquarters Service. There are few, if any, offices that can provide summer interns the diversity of practice areas and experiences that are available as an OSD Honors Legal Intern in DoD OGC. Summer interns in the OSD Honors Legal Internship Program are given considerable flexibility in their assignments. There are substantial opportunities to enhance research and drafting skills by working closely with OGC attorneys. Interns will assist in drafting and commenting on legislation, regulations, congressional testimony, litigation materials, and legal opinions. Interns will also have the opportunity to assist in the process of formulating DoD legal policy on high-profile topics of current interest. Our intern program may include visits to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Senate Armed Services Committee, military installations, Defense agencies and DoD field activities, and are all intended to familiarize the interns with the practice of law by Federal attorneys and the work of DoD in general."],"Education":"","Requirements":"","Evaluations":"DoD OGC seeks applicants with high academic qualifications and outstanding skill in written communications.
