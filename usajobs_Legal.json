The SF 15 will identify the supporting documentation required along with a list of the types of 10-point preference. The SF 15 is available from the OPM at https://www.gsa.gov/reference/forms. LOCALE INFORMATION\nSacramento, home to the world's second largest urban forest (behind Paris), sits just two hours between both San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. It is blessed with California's famed good weather, without the L.A. or San Francisco markup, and locals call Sacramento California's best kept secret. It's got big city amenities, but with a small town feel. America's best bike trail runs along the American River from the center of town up to Gold Country. And the wineries of Napa, and Sonoma, national parks like Yosemite and Sequoia, the beach and the mountains, are only a day trip away. Come see what makes Sacramento California's most livable metro - and why the Sacramento Area Human Resources Association named the Sacramento District the best large government agency to work for in Sacramento!","Requirements":"","Evaluations":"Once the announcement has closed, a review of your application package (resume, supporting documents, and responses to the questionnaire) will be used to determine whether you meet the qualification requirements listed on this announcement.
